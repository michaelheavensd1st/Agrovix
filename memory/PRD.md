# PRD — Agrovix AgOS

## Original Problem Statement
Enterprise-grade Agricultural Operating System (aquaculture / fish-hatchery
first). Monorepo: Next.js web + Expo mobile + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis.

## Sprint 0 — Foundation (accepted 2026-02)
Full monorepo scaffolding, JWT auth scaffold, Alembic-managed Postgres,
Turborepo + pnpm, GitHub Actions CI, Docker Compose.

## Sprint 1 — Identity, Tenancy, RBAC (this delta)

### Foundation corrections
- ✅ Replaced React Navigation with **Expo Router** (typed routes, file-based).
- ✅ Web auth = **httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies** (never localStorage).
- ✅ Mobile auth = **Expo SecureStore** (Keychain / EncryptedSharedPreferences).
- ✅ Structured **JSON logging** — request_id, user_id, organization_id, endpoint, status_code, duration_ms per request.
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry-ready Tracer interface** (no-op impl; swap-in ready).
- ✅ **Automated tests**: expired access, refresh rotation, revoked refresh, duplicate email, invalid credentials, unauthorized protected route, permission denial, ownership-orphan guard.
- ✅ No default superuser. `python -m app.cli create_admin` (interactive) creates the first platform administrator.
- ✅ CRA/Mongo preview clearly marked. `/app/PREVIEW_SHIM.md` documents policy; production code MongoDB-free (`scripts/verify-no-mongo.sh` in CI).
- ✅ Verified only "Agrovix" (no "Agrova" occurrences).

### Domain models (apps/api)
- User (extended: `is_verified`, `verified_at`, `deleted_at`)
- Role (permission-driven; adds `scope`, `is_system`)
- Permission
- RoleAssignment (user × role × org? × farm?; revocable; unique-per-scope)
- Organization (slug, soft delete, active flag)
- OrganizationMembership (user × org, invited_by, join meta, soft delete)
- Farm (org_id + code unique, soft delete)
- FarmMembership (user × farm, soft delete)
- Invitation (email + hashed token, status enum, expires_at, revoked_at, accepted_at)
- AuditEvent (actor / org / farm / action / entity / ip / ua / request_id / metadata JSON)
- EmailVerificationToken (hashed, single-use, expiring)

### Services (permission-driven)
- AuthService — register, verify_email, resend_verification, login (with cookies), refresh (rotate + revoke), logout
- OrganizationService — create (auto-owner assignment), delete (ownership guard)
- FarmService — create/update/delete (audited)
- InvitationService — create/accept/revoke (scope-aware; audited)
- RoleAssignmentService — assign/revoke (blocks last-owner revoke; audited)

### API endpoints (`/api/v1`)
Auth: register, verify, resend-verification, login, refresh, logout, me
Orgs: create/list/get/patch/delete
Farms: create-under-org, list-in-org, get, patch
Invitations: create, list, accept, revoke
Role assignments: create, revoke
Audit: list-in-org

### Web (apps/web)
- New pages: `/verify`, `/onboarding`, `/organizations/[id]`, `/organizations/[id]/farms/new`, `/organizations/[id]/invitations/new`, `/accept-invite`.
- API client uses `credentials: 'include'`. No token storage in JS.

### Mobile (apps/mobile)
- Expo Router shell: `app/_layout.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`, `app/login.tsx`, `app/register.tsx`, `app/dashboard.tsx`. AuthProvider + SecureStore.

### CI
- Adds `mongo-guard` job (`scripts/verify-no-mongo.sh`).
- Retains lint / type-check / vitest / next-build / ruff / black / pytest / audit.

### Not in Sprint 1 (intentional)
- Field, Crop, Season (aquaculture-first, deferred to Sprint 2).
- `scaffold:feature` code generator (only after patterns survive Sprint 1+).
- Full OpenTelemetry export (interface only).
- Resend / SendGrid production email backends (LogEmailSender ships).

## Sprint 1 hardening (2026-02-06)
- ✅ Postgres partial unique index on `email_verification_tokens (user_id) WHERE is_used = false` (migration `0003_verification_active_unique_index`) — prevents concurrent resends from creating multiple active tokens.
- ✅ Strict production rate-limiter fallback: `get_rate_limiter()` raises `RateLimiterUnavailableError` when Redis is required but missing/unreachable; `/health` reports rate-limiter backend + surfaces 503 if unhealthy in prod without explicit `RATE_LIMIT_ALLOW_INMEMORY` opt-in.
- ✅ Rate limiting on `/api/v1/auth/login` (per-email + per-IP) and `/api/v1/invitations/accept` (per-user + per-IP); responses stay generic to avoid enumeration.
- ✅ New login security suite (`test_login_security.py`): brute force → 429 w/ `Retry-After`, unknown-email parity, window-reset recovery, shared-state across "workers", IP-spraying detection.
- ✅ Terminology corrected: JWTs described as "signed, structured tokens backed by a server-side hashed record" (docstrings + shim comment).
- Test total: **27** (was 22; +5 new login security tests).

## Sprint 1 closeout (2026-02-06 pm)
- ✅ Farm soft delete + restore endpoints (`DELETE /farms/{id}` and `POST /farms/{id}/restore`). Deleted farms are excluded from list + read queries and reject new invitations with 409.
- ✅ Audit-event filtering (`farm_id`, `actor_id`, `action`, `entity_type`, `occurred_from`, `occurred_to`) + deterministic pagination (`created_at DESC, id DESC`) with hard-capped `limit=200`, returning `{items, total, limit, offset}` envelope.
- ✅ Tenant-existence leak plugged: `require_permission()` returns 404 (not 403) when the caller is not a member of the target organization. Applied uniformly to invitations, audit, role-assignments, farms.
- ✅ Concurrent-revoke race hardened: `RoleAssignmentService.revoke` uses a compare-and-swap primitive (`revoke_if_active`) + post-revoke count check that self-heals via `unrevoke` when a two-owner concurrent revoke would have orphaned an org.
- ✅ Trusted-proxy policy: new `TRUSTED_PROXIES` + `TRUSTED_PROXY_HEADER` settings; `app/core/trusted_proxy.py` resolves the true client IP right-to-left; direct socket peer is used when the peer is not a trusted proxy. Documented in `docs/trusted-proxy.md`.
- ✅ Every callsite that used `request.client.host` (login, resend, refresh, invitation accept, request-context middleware, audit log) now goes through `get_client_ip()`.
- ✅ Cross-tenant integration test suite (`test_cross_tenant.py`) covering list, read, update, delete, restore, invitation, audit, role-assignment endpoints — every access from a foreign tenant returns 404.
- ✅ Concurrency tests (`test_concurrency.py`) — asyncio.gather on same-assignment revoke, last-owner double-revoke, farm delete×2, delete/restore race.
- ✅ Trusted-proxy tests (`test_trusted_proxy.py`) — 9 cases covering spoofing, chain peeling, malformed headers, and login-endpoint integration.
- **Test total: 61** (previously 27 → +34).

### Backlog (deferred, NOT built)
- **Security posture panel** (P3, deferred): admin observability page. When implemented, it must use real metrics (Prometheus/Otel counters, structured logs) and operational data — NOT direct DB counts framed as security intelligence.
- **Real Resend backend** (P2, deferred): only when a staging env with a verified sending domain exists. API keys never committed; introduced via `apps/api/.env` per environment.
- **RateLimiter.ping()** protocol method (P2): current implementation uses `_client.ping()` directly. Only worth doing if we add a non-Redis backend that needs its own probe.

## Next Actions
1. Aquaculture domain: Hatchery, Pond, Batch, StockingEvent, FeedLog, MortalityLog.
2. Resend backend for `EmailSender` (verified sender + templated HTML).
3. Fine-grained audit UI + filtering + export.
4. Mobile onboarding flow (currently just shell).
